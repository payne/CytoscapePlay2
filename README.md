# Playing with js.cytoscape.org & Yjs.dev

## Slides are at https://bit.ly/YjsDemo1

Start with a  copy and paste of https://blog.js.cytoscape.org/2016/05/24/getting-started/

## Try it now with github pages:
### https://payne.github.io/CytoscapePlay2/index.html
That works in addition to the REPLit.com URL: https://replit.com/@payne/CytoscapePlay2

## Plan

Then play around... plan is to:
1. Add a button to add a node
3. Mix in https://docs.yjs.dev/
2. Add a drop down to add an edge
