# Playing with js.cytoscape.org

Start with a  copy and paste of https://blog.js.cytoscape.org/2016/05/24/getting-started/

## https://payne.github.io/CytoscapePlay2/index.html
That works in addition to the REPLit.com URL

## Plan

Then play around... plan is to:
1. Add a button to add a node
3. Mix in https://docs.yjs.dev/
2. Add a drop down to add an edge
